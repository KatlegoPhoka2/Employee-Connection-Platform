## ✨ Features

### 📅 Monthly Connection Recommendations
Each employee receives **3 curated connection recommendations** every month.

### 📧 Personalized Emails
Recommendation emails include employee profiles, direct connect actions, and automated workflow links.

### 🔗 One-Click Connection Initiation
Employees can send a connection invitation directly from their email — no extra steps.

### ✅ Accept / Reject Invitations
Invited employees can accept, decline, or ignore invitations at their own pace.

### 🤖 AI-Powered HR Email Understanding
The system uses LLMs to intelligently parse HR confirmation emails, identify employees, and resolve ambiguity.

> **Example:** `"Me and Mike connected today"` → The AI determines who sent the email and who "Mike" refers to.

### 🔍 Duplicate Name Detection
If multiple employees share a first name, the system automatically requests clarification.

> **Example:** `"We found multiple employees named Mike. Please reply using the employee's full name."`

### 📊 Automated Google Sheets Logging
All confirmed connections are automatically saved and tracked in Google Sheets.

### 📈 Analytics Dashboard
Connect Microsoft Power BI to analyze engagement rates, participation trends, department interactions, and networking patterns.

## ⚙️ Workflow Overview

### 1. Employee Data Loading
Reads employee records from Google Sheets, including fields like `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `department`.

### 2. Recommendation Generation
Generates 3 random connection recommendations per employee, excluding themselves, with duplicate prevention logic.

### 3. Email Distribution
Sends personalized recommendation emails with employee names, profiles, and connect action links.

### 4. Connection Initiation
When an employee clicks **Connect**, the system triggers invitation workflows, email automation, and status tracking.

### 5. HR Confirmation Workflow
After employees connect, they notify HR via a simple email (e.g., `"Me and Mike connected today"`).

### 6. AI Extraction & Validation
The AI workflow extracts names, validates against the employee database, handles duplicates, and requests clarification when needed.

### 7. Connection Storage
Validated connections are appended to Google Sheets, with future database support planned.

### 8. Analytics & Reporting
Power BI dashboards surface engagement participation, networking trends, department collaboration, and monthly activity.
